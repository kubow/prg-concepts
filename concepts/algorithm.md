An **algorithm** - a precise, unambiguous set of instructions designed to solve a problem or perform a task. 

Donald Knuth saysâ€¦ An algorithm: 
- Is finite 
- Is precisely defined 
- Has input 
- Has output 
- Must be effective

Complexity explained with Big O Notation:
- O(1) - constant time  (access an array element by index)
- O(*n*) - proportional time to input (linear search, simple loop)
- O(log *n*) - slowly grows based on input (binary search)
- O(*n* log *n*) - grows a bit more (merge sort, quick sort, heap sort)
- O(*n*^2) - impractical for large inputs (bubble, insertion or selection sort)
- O(2^*n*) - exponential time (naive Knapsack, some recursive algorithms)
- O(n!) - grows extremely fast (brute force combinatoric problems)

## Algorithm concepts

- Divide and Conquer (principle of problem decomposition and recursive problem solving)
- Dynamic programming (principle of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure)
- Graph Traversal (visiting all the vertices and edges in a graph)
	- Depth-First Search (DFS)
	- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
	- Dijkstra's Algorithm (optimal path finding)

## Algorithm types

- [Searching Algorithms](./algorithm_search.md) (Binary Search)
- [Sorting Algorithms](./algorithm_sort.md) (Quick Sort, merge Sort, ...)
- [Graph Algorithms](./algorithm_graph.md)





## Recursion

Recursion: a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

- Key Concept: A function calls itself to solve sub-problems.
- Relies and a base and recursive case.
- Can provides a clear and elegant way to solve complex problems.
