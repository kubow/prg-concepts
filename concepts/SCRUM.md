Scrum, a software development process developed by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka in 1986, has become highly popular as a general product development framework in today's businesses. If you're looking into trying this methodology, here are a few key terms that you need to familiarize yourself with before you get started.  
  
- **Product Owner** - The "Product Owner" represents the customer's voice in the development process. The "Product Owner" is actually a member of the development team who researches customer opinions and stories, and adds them to product backlog for the team's reference.
- **ScrumMaster** - The "ScrumMaster" (or "Scrum Master") facilitates the entire process. He or she serves as the buffer between the team and impediments or distractions, keeping the team focused on the current tasks. A ScrumMaster can also act as the Product Owner if ned be.
- **Teams** - The teams involved in this methodology who have cross-functional skills that can used to do the actual development work, including analysis and research, design and development, testing, and even documentation. Scrum teams typically have 5-9 members in them, and are usually self-organized (though team managers/leaders still fall under the authority of the ScrumMaster).
- **Backlog** - Backlogs are lists of tasks that the team needs to work on. There are two types of backlogs: the product backlog, which is the overall list of what needs to be done during the entire process; and the sprint backlog, which is a list of tasks that need to be completed during the sprint.  
- **Sprint** - Sprints in scrum methodology are time periods wherein the actual action and development occurs. They typically last for 2-4 weeks, and the tasks to be accomplished during each sprint are based on the sprint backlog.  
- **Sprint burn down chart** - This is a checklist of tasks that is updated on a daily basis during a sprint. This is displayed in such a way that all the team members can see and update it easily, and keep track of what remains to be accomplished.
- **Daily scrum** - Short, daily meetings that occur during a sprint. During this meeting, the team discusses what was accomplished the previous day, what needs to be done, and any problems or impediments that are hindering progress.
- **Sprint Retrospective** - A longer meeting that occurs at the end of a sprint, wherein team members get together to discuss the previous sprint and how the next one can be further improved.
