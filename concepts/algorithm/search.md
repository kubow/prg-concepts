## Arrays

- Fixed sequence of elements (0-based)
- Contiguous memory locations
- Each element can be accessed directly
- Storage and retrieval = O(1)

## Linked Lists

- Dynamic memory allocation (not contiguous)
- Efficient insertion and deletion (insert, delete, update and search)
- Node contain data and link/reference
- Implementing other data structures

## Hash Tables (Maps)

- A data structure that provides efficient access to data through the use of a key.
-  Provides O(1) insertions, look-ups, and deletion

## Stacks

- LIFO (Last In, First Out): The last element added is the first one to be removed.
- Common Operations: push, pop, peek.
- Use Cases: Expression evaluation, backtracking algorithms, function call management.
- Complexity: push and pop operations: O(1) O(1)

## Queues

- FIFO (First In, First Out): The first element added is the first one to be removed.
- Common Operations: enqueue, dequeue, front.
- Use Cases: Scheduling tasks, managing requests in web servers, BFS.
- Complexity: enqueue and dequeue operations: O(1) O(1)

## Heaps

- Binary Heaps: Complete binary tree used to implement priority queues.
- Types: Min-heap (smallest element at root) and max-heap (largest element at root).
- Use Cases: Priority queues, Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm, heap sort.
- Complexity: insert: O(log n) O(logn), extract-min or extract-max: O(log n) O(logn), find-min or find-max: O(1)O(1)
